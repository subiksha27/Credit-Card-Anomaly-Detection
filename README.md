# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes-and-KNN-algorithm

Anomaly is something that deviates from what is standard, normal, or expected.Those autonomous arrangements are usually mentioned as anomalies, outliers in numerous domains.Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains.

Anomalies might be induced in the data for a variety of reasons, such as malicious activity, e.g., credit card fraud, cyber-intrusion, terrorist activity or breakdown of a
system, but all of the reasons have a common characteristic that  are interesting to the analyst.

## Overview 
This project aims to classify the anomalous transactions by various techniques such as correlation heat map and some advanced classification algorithms to detect the outliers- Naive Bayes with an accuracy of 99.5% ,KNN algorithm with accuracy of 99.8%.
